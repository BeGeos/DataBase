The system is pretty straightforward: there are 2 classes (DataBase and Table), they both allows to create a database
connection and a Table object. The various methods represent a way to interact with a sqlite database, they form SQL queries
strings that are later executed.

For the whole procedure and process I still need to update a few things and a complete manual for handling and using
the class effectively will soon be available.

I find a very reliable and quick way to use SQL with Python, instead of writing queries, but using a more pythonistic
approach of Object-oriented programming.
